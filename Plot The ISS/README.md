# Plot the ISS

A simple script that I learned for plotting the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station). I followed this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CCTuHast0) by Python Programmer to learn this.

## Requirements:

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the script:

```
$ python3 src/main.py
```
