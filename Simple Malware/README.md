# Simple Malware

This is a simple ransomware script written as a proof of concept. I got the idea from a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtMMjXOlRQc) by NetworkChuck.
A lot of the code is based on this video, but I've tweaked it to encrypt all files in the following directories `["~/Downloads/", "~/Documents/", "~/Music/", "~/Pictures/", "~/Videos/"]`. Also, instead of using two scripts one to encrypt and one to decrypt, I've used a single script that encrypts and decrypts. You can chose your desired option (`infect` or `decrypt`) by running the script with the option as the first argument.

## Disclaimer

This is scrip is provided as a proof of concept, execute the script in a save environment that you **CAN** lose (for example in a virtual machine). Please use this script for **educational purposes** only and **NOT** to cause damage to **your** or **someone elses** computer.

## Settings up a safe testing environment

The steps below will guide you in creating a virtual machine using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). If you want to use an other virtualization software, please look up the steps for that software.

1. Download your favorite Linux distributions ISO file.
2. Install the [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) software.
3. Create a new virtual machine.
4. Install your favorite Linux distribution inside the virtual machine.
5. Install the [VirtualBox Guest Additions](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for the virtual machine.
6. Copy the script to the virtual machine (make sure you've shared clipboard enabled).
   <br>
   6.1. Open the script in your favorite text editor.
   <br>
   6.2. Copy the script to the clipboard (Ctrl + a ➜ Ctrl + c).
   <br>
   6.3. Open a terminal inside the virtual machine.
   <br>
   6.4. Open `nano` and paste the script into the file (Ctrl + Shift + v).
   <br>
   6.5. Save the file and close it (Ctrl + x ➜ y ➜ Enter).
   <br>
7. Create a snapshot of the virtual machine (so you can restore to a stable state any time).
8. Your testing environment is now ready to be used.

## Running the script

Once you've setup the virtual machine, you can run the script in the virtual machine.
To run the script, you'll need to open a terminal inside the virtual machine first. Then, you can run the script with your desired option.

**NOTE**: make sure the script is located in your current working directory. Otherwise, you cannot decrypt the files.

-  To infect/encrypt the files, run the script with the option `infect`:

```
$ python3 main.py infect
```

-  To decrypt the files, run the script with the option `decrypt`:

```
$ python3 main.py decrypt
```
