# Tic Tac Toe

I saw a video of [Alex Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQb3dE-y1S4) making a tic tac toe on Java and wanted to make a Tic Tac Toe game in Python. It's a rather simple implementation with probably to many `if else` statements. But hey it works! That's something right?

## Running the script

```bash
$ python3 main.py
```
